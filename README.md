Homework 8 - World Bank Indicator Analysis Gladys Ayanou

For this assignment, I’m working with data from the World Bank's World Development Indicator (WDI) database. The goal is to analyze different global development trends like economic growth, health, education, and more. I’ll be cleaning the data, doing some analysis, and then creating a report with my findings.

Data: This is where the WDI dataset is stored. It includes different stats for countries like GDP, inflation rates, education levels, and other important indicators.

Code: The main code that I will write for cleaning, analyzing, and creating visuals will go here (e.g., in data_analysis.py).

Report: The final report will be in HTML format, created using Quarto. It’ll summarize what I found in the data and include any graphs or charts I made.
